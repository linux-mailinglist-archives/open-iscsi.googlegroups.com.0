The first version of Word for Windows was released in 1989. With the 
release of Windows 3.0 the following year, sales began to pick up and 
Microsoft soon became the market leader for word processors for IBM 
PC-compatible computers.[13] In 1991, Microsoft capitalized on Word for 
Windows' increasing popularity by releasing a version of Word for DOS, 
version 5.5, that replaced its unique user interface with an interface 
similar to a Windows application.[28][29] When Microsoft became aware of 
the Year 2000 problem, it made Microsoft Word 5.5 for DOS available for 
free downloads. As of February 2021[update], it is still available for 
download from Microsoft's website.[30]In 1991, Microsoft embarked on a 
project code-named Pyramid to completely rewrite Microsoft Word from the 
ground up. Both the Windows and Mac OS versions would start from the same 
code base. It was abandoned when it was determined that it would take the 
development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new 
capabilities that could have been added at the same time without a rewrite. 
Instead, the next versions of Word for Windows and Mac OS, dubbed version 
6.0, both started from the code base of Word for Windows 2.0.[24]

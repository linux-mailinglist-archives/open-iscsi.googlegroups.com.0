We didn't have our wedding at the Irish pub because, well, it was shut down 
temporarily because of health code violations. This wedding chicken cordon 
bleu was the guests' favorite, and it l our favorite too.
Ina Garten Chicken Cordon Bleu Recipel

*DOWNLOAD* https://stitdaewsumpde.blogspot.com/?ua=2wITFx


There are a lot of different ways to make this classic dish. I used to 
think of chicken cordon bleu as a dish where the chicken breast is 
flattened, stuffed, rolled, flash fried, then baked in the oven. However, 
my mom always made it folded in half and baked rather than rolled and 
fried. And I'll tell you what: this method is just as awesome as fried and 
doesn't require as much technique.

For example, there are methods to choose from. The first is butterfly, 
stuff & fold, like my cordon bleu. Next option, slice down the top of 
breast to make a pocket, stuff crumpled tin foil into the pocket, sear it, 
then add the filling into the pocket. This seems like it will work if you 
have a creamier filling. Lastly, there is the rolling method: butterfly the 
breast, pound it thin, lay out/spread your filling onto the chicken, then 
roll the breast. For this type of technique your filling should lay flat 
and not be bulky. There are so many exciting combinations and methods to 
try! Also, yes, there are many more variations on how best to stuff your 
boneless chicken breast. These are simply a jumping off point!
